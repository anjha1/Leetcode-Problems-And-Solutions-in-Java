# [446. Arithmetic Slices II - Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices-ii-subsequence/)



Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$. $n$ is the length of `nums`.
- Space Complexity: $O(n^2)$. `f` is a Map with $n$ length, and the map is saved `d` which has at most n size. In total, the space complexity is $O(n^2)$.
