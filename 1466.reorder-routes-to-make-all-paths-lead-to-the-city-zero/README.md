# [1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-routes-to-make-all-paths-lead-to-the-city-zero/)


Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. $n$ is the city number. BFS costs $O(n)$ and iterate all paths costs  $O(n -1)$. The total time complexity is $O(2n-1)=O(n)$.
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$. Queue and array cost $O(n)$.
