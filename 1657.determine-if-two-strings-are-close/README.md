# [1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-strings-are-close/)


Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. $n$ is the length of input String.
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$. We only use constant size of array. The input of sorting is constant as well. Thus, the total space complexity is $O(1)$.
