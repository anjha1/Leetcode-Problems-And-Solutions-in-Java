# [502. IPO](https://leetcode.com/problems/ipo/)



Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. $n$ is the length of `profits` and `capitals`. Sorting array costs $O(n\log n)$ and adding an element to heap and sorting heap costs $O(k\log n)$. The total time complexity is $O((n+k)\log n)$.
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$.
