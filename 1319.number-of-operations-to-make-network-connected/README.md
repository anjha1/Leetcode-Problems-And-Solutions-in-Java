# [1319. Number of Operations to Make Network Connected](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-operations-to-make-network-connected/)



Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $O(n+m)$. $m$ is the length of `connections`.
- Space Complexity: $O(n+m)$. It costs $O(m)$ to save all edges and costs $O(n)$ for DFS stack.
