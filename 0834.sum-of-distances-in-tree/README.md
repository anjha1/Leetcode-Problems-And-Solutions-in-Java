# [834. Sum of Distances in Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-distances-in-tree/)



Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. $n$ is the number of tree nodes. We only need to traverse nodes twice to get the answer, so the time complexity is $O(2n)=O(n)$.
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$. We have three arrays, dp, size and ans. The space complexity is $O(3n)=O(n)$.
