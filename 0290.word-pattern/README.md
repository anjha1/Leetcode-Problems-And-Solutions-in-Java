# [290. Word Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern/)


Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $O(n+m)$. $n$ is the length of s and $m$ is the length of pattern. Each character is only traverse at most once.
- Space Complexity: $O(n+m)$. The size of two maps is $n$ and $m$ respectively.
