# [20. Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $O(n)$. $n$ is the length of s.
- Space Complexity: $O(n + m)$. $m$ is the size of hash table which is 6 in this question. The max amount of stack is $O(n)$, $n$ is the length of $s$.
