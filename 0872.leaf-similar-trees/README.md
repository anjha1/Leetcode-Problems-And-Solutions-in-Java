# [872. Leaf-Similar Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/)



Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $O(n_1+n_2)$. $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the number of nodes in the two trees respectively.
- Space Complexity: $O(n_1+n_2)$. Space complexity depends on the stack size of the recursion.
