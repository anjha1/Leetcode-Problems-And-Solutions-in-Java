# [28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/)


Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $O(n+m)$. $n$ is the length of haystack and $m$ is the length of needle. We need to iterate them twice, so the time complexity is $O(n+m)$.
- Space Complexity: $O(m)$.
