# [1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)


Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $O(mn)$. $m$ and $n$ are the length of text1 and text2 respectively.
- Space Complexity: $O(mn)$. we created an array for DP and the space complexity is $O(mn)$.
