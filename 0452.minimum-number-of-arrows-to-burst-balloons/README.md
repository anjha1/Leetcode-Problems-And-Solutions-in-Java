# [452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/)


Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: $O(n\log n)$. The time complexity of sorting is $O(n\log n)$ and the iteration is $O(n)$. The total time complexity is $O(n\log n)$.
- Space Complexity: $O(\log n)$. The space of sort stack is $O(\log n)$.
